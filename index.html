					In case you were curious, in Classical Greece the Democracy was worried about power being concentrated in the hands of a popular tyrant. To nip this threat in the bud, the city-state would perioidcally cast out powerful statesmen for 10 years at a time. This was called "Ostrakos" named after the pottery shard the Assembly used to vote for the unlucky statesman. This is where we get the word "Ostracism" from.
